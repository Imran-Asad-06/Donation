        <h1>Lets Help Those People Who Are More Than in Need.</h1>

        <p class="para">Every penny donated makes a huge difference to the work we do, young children and their
            families. It
            literally can mean a case of life or death for some.
            While all gifts are gratefully received, a regular donation is best for the charity to be able to plan ahead
            to achieve its goals in relieving people from poverty.</p>
